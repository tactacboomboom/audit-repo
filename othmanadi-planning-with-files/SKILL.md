Work like Manus: Use persistent markdown files as your "working memory on disk."

## FIRST: Check for Previous Session (v2.2.0)

**Before starting work**, check for unsynced context from a previous session:

```bash
# Linux/macOS (auto-detects python3 or python)
$(command -v python3 || command -v python) ~/.codex/skills/planning-with-files/scripts/session-catchup.py "$(pwd)"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
python "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\planning-with-files\scripts\session-catchup.py" (Get-Location)
```

If catchup report shows unsynced context:
1. Run `git diff --stat` to see actual code changes
2. Read current planning files
3. Update planning files based on catchup + git diff
4. Then proceed with task

## Important: Where Files Go

- **Templates** are in `~/.codex/skills/planning-with-files/templates/`
- **Your planning files** go in **your project directory**

| Location | What Goes There |
|----------|-----------------|
| Skill directory (`~/.codex/skills/planning-with-files/`) | Templates, scripts, reference docs |
| Your project directory | `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md` |

## Quick Start

Before ANY complex task:

1. **Create `task_plan.md`** — Use templates/task_plan.md as reference
2. **Create `findings.md`** — Use templates/findings.md as reference
3. **Create `progress.md`** — Use templates/progress.md as reference
4. **Re-read plan before decisions** — Refreshes goals in attention window
5. **Update after each phase** — Mark complete, log errors

> **Note:** Planning files go in your project root, not the skill installation folder.

## The Core Pattern

```
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

→ Anything important gets written to disk.
```

## File Purposes

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `task_plan.md` | Phases, progress, decisions | After each phase |
| `findings.md` | Research, discoveries | After ANY discovery |
| `progress.md` | Session log, test results | Throughout session |

## Critical Rules

### 1. Create Plan First
Never start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. Non-negotiable.

### 2. The 2-Action Rule
> "After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files."

### 3. Read Before Decide
Before major decisions, read the plan file.

### 4. Update After Act
After completing any phase: mark status `in_progress` → `complete`, log errors, note files changed.

### 5. Log ALL Errors

### 6. Never Repeat Failures
```
if action_failed:
    next_action != same_action
```

## The 3-Strike Error Protocol

- ATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix root cause
- ATTEMPT 2: Alternative approach — NEVER repeat exact failing action
- ATTEMPT 3: Broader rethink, question assumptions
- AFTER 3: Escalate to user

## The 5-Question Reboot Test

| Question | Answer Source |
|----------|---------------|
| Where am I? | Current phase in task_plan.md |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
| What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |
| What have I learned? | findings.md |
| What have I done? | progress.md |

## When to Use

**Use for:** multi-step tasks (3+ steps), research, building projects, anything requiring organization.
**Skip for:** simple questions, single-file edits, quick lookups.

## Scripts

- `scripts/init-session.sh` — Initialize all planning files
- `scripts/check-complete.sh` — Verify all phases complete
- `scripts/session-catchup.py` — Recover context from previous session (v2.2.0)
- `scripts/resolve-plan-dir.sh` — Find active plan directory (env → .active_plan → newest mtime)
- `scripts/set-active-plan.sh` — Pin .planning/.active_plan to a plan_id

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Use TodoWrite for persistence | Create task_plan.md file |
| State goals once and forget | Re-read plan before decisions |
| Hide errors and retry silently | Log errors to plan file |
| Stuff everything in context | Store large content in files |
| Start executing immediately | Create plan file FIRST |
| Repeat failed actions | Track attempts, mutate approach |
| Create files in skill directory | Create files in your project |
